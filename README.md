# Predictive Wildfire Damage to Populated Regions at Wildland-Urban Interfaces
### A Case-Based Survey of Hazard Factors in Victoria, Australia and California, United States

#### ABOUT

##### Currently not a final version.

This repository contains the javascript files and some binaries created from them for application and your verification from the thesis "Predictive Wildfire Damage to Populated Regions at Wildland-Urban Interfaces: A Case-Based Survey of Hazard Factors in Victoria, Australia and California, United States" by Taniguchi-Wiegman, A., with support from professor Takeuchi, W. and lab members. The paper has not been published in a journal, but the license to publish the paper remains with the author(s). These scripts are applied through various collection of landcover imagery, urbanization prediction, nighttime lights, population distribution, surface temperature, soil moisture, drought index, wind, precipitation, and the location of firefighting stations (etc).

The final product may or may not load with the default memory provided by Google in Google Earth Engine, but it can be re-created from the original part-files in more broken-down risk maps.

If permissions were set wrong on any asset, fusion table (will eventually be migrated to assets before Google sunsets at End-Of-Year 2019), or other file please contact me directly at hello[-at-]madicetea[-dot-]me. Thank you.

#### THANKS

The author thanks Mr. Dalemans for his GitHub repo @ https://github.com/FlorisDalemans/biofuel-profitability/, as it serves the basis for this README file.

The author also thanks Google Earth Engine for providing a convenient platform for the en-masse data collection, analysis, and calculation/visualization of Remote Sensing information. Without this and their training sessions, this project would not have been possible. (On that note, a thank you to Mr. Michael DeWitt of Google for teaching me how to effectively export and use coloring as-appears in the GEE editor in my exports.)

Additionally, the author thanks Dr. W. Takeuchi -- thesis advisor at the University of Tokyo, for guidance and creation of the KBDI (Keetch-Bryam Drought Index) database used for the Australia region in this report.

Finally, the author thanks :

(1) Drs. Haemi Park and Prakhar Mishra for their constant guidance and encouragement.

(2) Mr. Xuan Truong Trinh for giving me a timeline and teaching me about spectrum graphs.

(3) Mrs. Etsuko Nakazono, for her technical guidance on LANDSAT imagery.

(4) Mr. Yan Guanyu, for always being there to debug my programming code.

(5) Mrs. Nguyen Thi Quynh Trang and Mrs. Nuntikorn Kitratporn for their guidance on flowchart software and for teaching me the difference between emissions and burned-area analysis.

(6) Dr. Hinori Arai for his guidance when I was first choosing a topic.

(7) All other members of W. Takeuchi lab for their assistance and encouragement.
